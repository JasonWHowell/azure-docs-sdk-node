# Azure Backup Modules for Node.js

## Overview

Azure Backup is the Azure-based service you can use to back up (or protect) and restore your data in the Microsoft cloud. Azure Backup replaces your existing on-premises or off-site backup solution with a cloud-based solution that is reliable, secure, and cost-competitive. Azure Backup offers multiple components that you download and deploy on the appropriate computer, server, or in the cloud. The component, or agent, that you deploy depends on what you want to protect. All Azure Backup components (no matter whether you're protecting data on-premises or in the cloud) can be used to back up data to a Recovery Services vault in Azure. 

## Management package

### Install the modules with npm

Use npm to install the Azure Backup modules for Node.js

```bash
npm install azure-arm-recoveryservicesbackup
```

### Example

This example lists the recovery jobs for a given vault and resource group.

```javascript
const msRestAzure = require('ms-rest-azure');
const RecoveryServicesBackupManagement = require('azure-arm-recoveryservicesbackup');

const subcriptionId = 'your-subscription-id';
const vault = 'your-recovery-service-vault';
const resourceGroupName = 'your-resource-group';

msRestAzure
  .interactiveLogin()
  .then(credentials => {
    const client = new RecoveryServicesBackupManagement(
      credentials,
      subcriptionId
    );
    return client.jobs.list(vault, resourceGroupName);
  })
  .then(jobs => console.dir(jobs, { depth: null, colors: true }))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```
